                <h2>Western Europe's youngest countries</h2>
                <p>Italy has one of Europe's longest histories, yet it's only been a country since 1861. In Roman times Italy was a single entity. It then divided into a collection of sovereign states and remained that way until 1861.
                  This long history of individuality is why the country today has such a wide range of cultural variations.</p>

                <h2>The country was under a dictatorship for 20 years</h2>
                <p>
                  Benito Mussolini established a dictatorship in Italy in 1925 and ruled the country until 1945.

                  Known as Il Duce at the height of his powers, Mussolini wasn't always a fascist. In fact he began his political life as a radical socialist, and served as Italian PM until 1922.

                <h2>Italy's flag is green, white and red</h2>
                <p>Italy's flag represents hope, faith and charity. Green is hope, white denotes faith and red is the colour of charity. Inspired by the French flag, it's often called Il Tricolore.

                  Tricolore Day in Italy is 7 January. And it's celebrated on Reggio Emilia, at the very spot where the flag was first adopted in 1797.</p>

              Tourists toss around €3,000 a day into the fountain. This amounts to roughly €1,000,000 every year, which is all donated to charity.
